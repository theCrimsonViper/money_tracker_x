# money_tracker_x

My wife is angry at me some years ago because she couldn't figure out why our budget for expenses is almost exhausted before my next pay date. So, I used Google Sheets to keep track of all expenses.

Eventually, while I was self-studying computer science and programmming, I thought to myself "why not make a software where I can track our expenses". I was learning Python at the time.
